    "Classically, given a boundary value problem for linear PDEs with constant coefficient, we rely on separation of variables and specific integral transforms to find the explicit solution. The standard methods are a in collection of situation-wise approaches targeting specific boundary equations and boundary conditions. These approaches involve separation of variables, Fourier seires and transforms, Laplace's transforms, Sturmâ€“Liouville theory, and other integral transforms. It becomes difficult, however, for the standard methods to solve higher order PDEs. On the other hand, the method of Fokas gives the equivalent solution as the standard methods provide, but the generality surpasses. "
